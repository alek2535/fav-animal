    <p>Lion don't really live in the jungle. According to Wikipedia they mostly live in grasslands or savannas. So where does the nickname come from? Who knows! They're big scary cats that we all enjoy! </p>
    
    <p>They also are run by the females of the herd and the males are forced to leave when they become adults so they all don't kill each other and for breeding purposes. Every cat in the pack is family so the males must leave to create a new family of their own.</p>
